Goals and plus functions for the above related specs:

 - 1 - Up to 16GB. Compatible .CSV format with RaceRender 3.0 Data Analisis and Data-Overlay video (FREEWARE). 
 - 2 - 10 times a second GPS data for: automatic on-track recognition (plus than 1000 tracks available), accurate track lines path on every curve, automatic lap timer, accurate time, date, altitude and moving speed. 
 - 3 - 50 times a second High-speed (every 20ms) data logging for high variable data sensors (suspension, G- forces, tire and brake temperatures, etc.) 
 - 4 - Includes SHIFT-light indicator, Engine RPM, ECU speed, GEAR and on-screen alerts for too high Coolant temperature. 
 - 5 - Inside tire temperature and pression. Includes on-screen alerts for too low or too high tire pressure. Includes easy "check-by-Colour" optimum values. 
 - 6 - Includes "check-by-Colour "values and alerts for too low temperature. At car setup, includes camber tips for optimum performance with 3 zone data logging: outside, middle and inside temps for each car tire or left, centre and right temps for each motorcycle (bike) tire.
 - 7 - Ambient temperature, pressure and humidity. Includes alerts for too low ambient temperature. 
 - 8 - Acceleration, braking and turning forces. Includes lean angle for motorcycles. Includes under/over steering indicator. 
 - 9 - Includes alerts for too low orto high values. 
 - 10 - 
 - 11 - Only if not OBD II option module chosen. 
 - 12 - Includes SAG easy process adjustment step by step, with tips and advices. Also includes line SAG with "check-by-Colour "optimum values. Includes alerts for too much diving orto por SAG. 
 - 13 - Only for models equipad with UP/DOWN shifter. Mandatory OBD II module option. Totally tunable with 4 riding modes: ECO, STREET, SPORT and TRACK, and each mode totally configurable for UP, DOWN, RPM histeresys values.
 - 14 - Brake sensor with 2 options: on/off or a proper pressure gauge (needs installation of a new brake line hose). 
 - 15 - 5" HD touchscreen monitor with RPM LEDs indicators to: show all the LIVE data, proper gear change indicator, manage information, navigate through menus, better design, varios screens.
